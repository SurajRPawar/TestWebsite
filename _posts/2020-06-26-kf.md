Right before the voice of Neil Armstrong proclaimed these words, Buzz Aldrin was reading out the coordinates of the lunar module to Neil Armstrong, who was navigating the historic Apollo 11 mission. The algorithm that was displaying those position coordinates to Buzz, was a Kalman Filter. 

In my opinion, that was the first dent in the universe before Steve Jobs.
