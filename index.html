<p>Hello! I am a PhD student under <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/longoria">Prof Raul Longoria</a> at <a href="https://cockrell.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. I&#39;m currently <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/longoria/system-modeling-estimation-and-control-for-cardiovascular-systems-with-mechanical-circulatory-support/">investigating</a> how to use data provided by an implantable heart pump (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_assist_device">Left Ventricular Assist Device</a>) to estimate physiological parameters of the patient. My work involves model based techniques such as <strong>Kalman Filters</strong>, as well as data driven approaches using <strong>machine learning</strong>. We test these methods both in simulation, and in <strong>Hardware-in-the-Loop</strong> experiments.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am passionate about music! I play the acoustic guitar and sing. I've recently picked up photography and am trying to get better at it. You can find my singing on Instagram and YouTube (linked below)! At other times, I can be found chilling with my cat Buttercup üêà</p>
