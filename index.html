<p>Hello! I'm an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/surajpawar1/">engineer</a> by profession, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/surajpawar">musician</a> / <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/surajpawarclicks">photographer</a> by hobby.  As an engineer, I have expertise in system modelling and controls and have earned a Master's degree from UT Austin under <a href="https://sites.utexas.edu/longoria">Prof Raul Longoria</a>. You will find a (short) list of publication from my time there <a href = "https://surajrpawar.github.io/publications/">here</a></p>


<p>I try to write once in a while on my <a href = "https://surajrpawar.github.io/blog/">blog</a>, and it goes without saying that the thoughts posted there are mine alone and do not represent any organization that I am a part of. Lastly, I'm a cat person and love to spoil my cat Buttercup üêà</p>
